- Created `PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGES` constant with 40+ supported languages for Monaco editor
- Built `LanguageSelect` component using existing shadcn Select for consistency
- Updated `ItemCreateDialog.tsx` and `DrawerEditBody.tsx` to conditionally show language dropdown for code-enabled item types
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing text inputs for non-code content
- Enables real-time syntax highlighting in Monaco editor based on selected language

### 2026-04-15 — Auth Pages Nav & Dashboard Logo

- Added homepage `Navbar` component to `/sign-in` and `/register` pages with `pt-16` top padding for fixed navbar offset
- Replaced dashboard top bar logo (the `S` box div) with `Package` icon from lucide-react (`h-5 w-5`), matching the homepage navbar logo
- Build and all 61 tests pass

### 2026-04-15 — UI Review Fixes

- Used Playwright to visually inspect homepage and dashboard at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px)
- **FadeIn** (`FadeIn.tsx`): sections no longer start invisible — elements in viewport stay visible, off-screen elements animate on scroll, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Mobile nav** (`Navbar.tsx`): added hamburger menu with Features/Pricing links and Sign In/Get Started buttons for mobile (<md)
- **Mobile hero** (`page.tsx`): hid chaos-icons + arrow on mobile, show only compact dashboard preview; full visual on md+
- **CTA gradient**: changed endpoint from `slate-300` to `blue-300` across page.tsx, Navbar.tsx, PricingSection.tsx for better white text contrast
- **Sidebar** (`Sidebar.tsx`): capitalized type names via `capitalize` class; empty "Favorites" heading hidden when no favorited collections
- **Stats cards** (`StatsCards.tsx`): 4-col grid at `md` breakpoint (was `lg`); shortened "Favorite Collections" to "Fav. Collections"
- **Collection cards** (`CollectionCard.tsx`): fixed "1 items" → "1 item" grammar; equalized card heights with `h-full flex flex-col` + `mt-auto`; conditional description render
- **Favorites mobile** (`FavoritesList.tsx`): type badge replaced with small colored icon on mobile to reduce title truncation
- **Mobile brand** (`DashboardShell.tsx`): show "S" badge on all sizes instead of "DS" text on mobile
- Build passes

- Build passes

### 2026-04-06 — Auth Setup — NextAuth + GitHub Provider

- Installed `next-auth@beta` and `@auth/prisma-adapter`
- Created split auth config: `src/auth.config.ts` (edge-safe, GitHub provider only) + `src/auth.ts` (full config with PrismaAdapter)
- JWT session strategy with `user.id` injected via `jwt` and `session` callbacks

- Build passes

### 2026-04-08 — Fix GitHub OAuth Redirect

- Created `src/actions/auth.ts` with `signInWithGitHub` server action using `signIn` from `@/auth`
- Updated `SignInForm.tsx` — GitHub button now uses `<form action={signInWithGitHub}>` instead of client-side `onClick` with `signIn` from `next-auth/react`
- Uses `redirectTo: "/dashboard"` (NextAuth v5 pattern) for server-side redirect
- Credentials login unchanged (still client-side `signIn` with `redirect: false`)
- Build passes

### 2026-04-09 — Dashboard Card Left Borders

- `CollectionsSection.tsx` — collection cards now use `border-l-4` with only `borderLeftColor` set to the dominant type color (was full colored border)
- `ItemRow.tsx` — reworked from list row to standalone card: `rounded-lg border border-l-4 bg-card p-3` with `borderLeftColor` set to the item's type color
- `PinnedItems.tsx` / `RecentItems.tsx` — removed outer card wrapper; now `flex flex-col gap-2` so each ItemRow stands as its own card with small margins between them
- Build passes

### 2026-04-09 — Items List View

- Created dynamic route `src/app/items/[type]/page.tsx` — protected server component wrapped in `DashboardShell`
- Added `getSystemItemTypeBySlug(slug)` and `getItemsByType(userId, typeId)` to `src/lib/db/items.ts`
- Slug resolver accepts both singular (`/items/snippet`) and plural (`/items/snippets`) forms; 404s on unknown slugs via `notFound()`

- Build passes

### 2026-04-09 — Vitest Unit Testing Setup

- Installed `vitest` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` as dev dependencies
- Added `vitest.config.ts` — `node` environment, globals enabled, `resolve.tsconfigPaths: true` for `@/*` aliases, tests scoped to `src/actions/**` and `src/lib/**` (components explicitly excluded)
- Added `"types": ["vitest/globals"]` to `tsconfig.json` for ambient `describe`/`it`/`expect`
- Added `test`, `test:run`, and `test:coverage` scripts to `package.json`
- Added sample test `src/lib/utils.test.ts` covering `cn()` — all tests pass
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`, `context/coding-standards.md`, and `context/ai-interaction.md` with testing scope (server actions + lib only, no components), conventions, and updated workflow step
- Build and lint pass

### 2026-04-09 — Items List 3-Column Grid

- Updated `src/app/items/[type]/page.tsx` grid container from `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Responsive: 1 column on mobile, 2 columns from `md`, 3 columns from `lg` (≥1024px)

- Build and tests pass

### 2026-04-09 — Item Drawer

- Installed shadcn `sheet` component
- Added `getItemDetail(userId, itemId)` to `src/lib/db/items.ts` — full item with type, collection, tags, content, url, language
- Created `GET /api/items/[id]` route with auth check — 401 unauthorized, 404 when item missing or not owned by user
- Built `src/components/items/ItemDrawer.tsx` — right-side shadcn Sheet, skeleton loading state, action bar (Favorite ★ yellow when active, Pin, Copy, Edit, right-aligned Delete), meta grid, tags, content (pre/mono), URL
- Built `src/components/items/ItemDrawerContext.tsx` — `ItemDrawerProvider` + `useItemDrawer()` hook managing open state and selected item id; clears id after close animation
- `ItemCard.tsx` and `ItemRow.tsx` converted to client `<button>` components that call `openItem(id)` on click
- Provider mounted in `DashboardShell.tsx` so drawer works on dashboard and items list pages without page changes
- Copy button writes `content ?? url ?? title` to clipboard; Favorite/Pin/Edit/Delete wired visually only (mutations out of scope per spec)
- Build passes, all existing tests pass

### 2026-04-09 — Item Drawer Edit Mode

- Installed `zod` for input validation
- Added `updateItem(userId, itemId, input)` to `src/lib/db/items.ts` — transactional: updates fields, deletes all `ItemTag` rows, upserts `Tag` rows by `(name, userId)`, recreates joins; returns full `ItemDetail` via `getItemDetail`
- Created `src/actions/items.ts` with `updateItem` server action — Zod schema (title required, nullable trimmed strings, `z.url()` validation, tag dedupe), `auth()` + ownership check, `{ success, data, error }` contract. Schema is module-local (not exported) because `"use server"` files can only export async functions
- Split `ItemDrawer.tsx` into `DrawerViewBody` / `DrawerEditBody`; Edit button toggles `editing` state; Save/Cancel replace the action bar in edit mode
- Editable fields: title (required), description, tags (comma-separated); type-specific content (snippet/prompt/command/note), language (snippet/command), url (link)
- Non-editable in edit mode: item type, collection, dates
- Uses `useTransition` for pending state; sonner toasts on success/error; `router.refresh()` after save so card lists reflect changes
- Save disabled client-side while title is empty; Zod is server-side source of truth
- Added `src/actions/items.test.ts` — 6 Vitest cases: unauthorized, empty title, invalid URL, ownership miss, happy path (asserts trim + tag dedupe), query throw
- Build and all 9 tests pass

### 2026-04-09 — Item Delete

- Installed shadcn `alert-dialog` component
- Added `deleteItem(itemId)` to `src/lib/db/items.ts` — Prisma delete; cascades remove `ItemTag` rows via schema; caller verifies ownership
- Added `deleteItem` server action to `src/actions/items.ts` — `auth()` + ownership check via `findFirst`, `{ success, data: { id }, error }` contract
- Wired Delete button in `ItemDrawer.tsx` with controlled `AlertDialog` (destructive styling); confirmation shows the item title
- On success: sonner toast, drawer closes via `onOpenChange(false)`, `router.refresh()` so pinned/recent/items-by-type/stats reflect the deletion; on error: sonner error toast
- Uses `useTransition` for pending state; Delete button and Cancel disabled while deleting
- Added 4 Vitest cases to `src/actions/items.test.ts`: unauthorized, ownership miss, happy path, query throw
- Build and all 13 tests pass

### 2026-04-09 — Item Create

- Added `createItem(userId, input)` to `src/lib/db/items.ts` — transactional: creates `Item` with `contentType: 'text'`, upserts `Tag` rows by `(name, userId)`, creates joins; returns full `ItemDetail` via `getItemDetail`
- Added `createItem` server action to `src/actions/items.ts` — Zod schema with `type` enum (`snippet`/`prompt`/`command`/`note`/`link`), refine rule requiring URL for link type, reuses `nullableTrimmedString` + tag dedupe from update schema. Looks up system `ItemType` by name inside the action, returns `{ success, data, error }`
- Created `src/components/items/ItemCreateDialog.tsx` — shadcn Dialog with 5-button segmented type selector (colored icon + label from `typeIconMap`), conditional fields per type (content for snippet/prompt/command/note, language for snippet/command, url for link), form reset on close, sonner toast + `router.refresh()` on success
- Wired "New Item" top bar button in `DashboardShell.tsx` to open the dialog; passes through existing `itemTypes` prop
- Added 7 Vitest cases to `src/actions/items.test.ts`: unauthorized, empty title, link missing URL, invalid URL, system type not found, happy path (trim + tag dedupe + typeId forwarded), query throw
- Build and all 20 tests pass

### 2026-04-10 — Code Editor Component

- Installed `@monaco-editor/react` package
- Created `src/components/items/CodeEditor.tsx` — Monaco Editor wrapper with macOS window dots (red/yellow/green), language label, copy button with "Copied" feedback, `vs-dark` theme, fluid height (min 100px, max 400px), slim 8px scrollbars, no minimap
- Updated `ItemDrawer.tsx` view mode — snippets and commands use `CodeEditor` (readonly) instead of `<pre>`; notes and prompts keep plain `<pre>`
- Updated `ItemDrawer.tsx` edit mode — snippets and commands use `CodeEditor` (editable) instead of `<textarea>`; notes and prompts keep `<textarea>`
- Updated `ItemCreateDialog.tsx` — same split: `CodeEditor` for snippet/command content, `<textarea>` for note/prompt
- Added `defaultType` prop to `ItemCreateDialog` for pre-selecting item type on open
- Exported `useOpenCreateDialog` context from `DashboardShell` so child components can trigger the create dialog
- Added `defaultCreateType` prop to `DashboardShell`, forwarded to the dialog
- Created `src/components/items/NewItemByTypeButton.tsx` — "New [Type]" button using the create dialog context
- Updated `src/app/items/[type]/page.tsx` — renders type-specific "New [Type]" button in the page header; passes `defaultCreateType` to `DashboardShell`
- Build and all 20 tests pass

### 2026-04-10 — Markdown Editor for Notes & Prompts

- Installed `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, and `@tailwindcss/typography`
- Registered `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"` in `globals.css` (Tailwind v4 CSS-based config)
- Created `src/components/items/MarkdownEditor.tsx` — Write/Preview tabbed editor with `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`, copy button, dark theme container matching CodeEditor styling (`bg-[#1e1e1e]` body, `bg-[#252526]` header)
- Preview uses `prose prose-invert prose-sm` classes from `@tailwindcss/typography` for proper rendering of headings, code blocks, inline code, lists, blockquotes, links, tables, and task lists
- Readonly mode shows Preview tab only; edit mode defaults to Write tab with Preview available
- Fluid height with max 400px matching CodeEditor
- Updated `ItemDrawer.tsx` view mode — notes and prompts use `MarkdownEditor` (readonly) instead of `<pre>`
- Updated `ItemDrawer.tsx` edit mode — notes and prompts use `MarkdownEditor` instead of `<textarea>`
- Updated `ItemCreateDialog.tsx` — notes and prompts use `MarkdownEditor` instead of `<textarea>`
- Snippets and commands unchanged (still use CodeEditor)
- Build and all 20 tests pass

### 2026-04-10 — File & Image Upload with Cloudflare R2

- Uses plain `<img>` tag (not `next/image`) because the R2 download proxy stream isn't compatible with Next.js image optimization
- Updated `src/app/items/[type]/page.tsx` — renders `ImageCard` for image type, regular `ItemCard` for all others
